			       To-do List


Things to be done, by no particular order:

- Use page ID's instead of "paths" as page locator.

- Replace MySQL FULLTEXT index by a custom fulltext indexing suited to our specific needs:
  
  - avoiding to have a plaintext duplicate version of each page, therfore saving space

  - consider using a word hash for fast lookup
