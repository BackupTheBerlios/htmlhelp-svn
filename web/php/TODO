Things to be done (by no particular order):

- Compress the generated TOC and index pages and be nicer to web caches for
  bandwith saving since TOC and indexes can be quite big. Some resources are:

  * http://php.weblogs.com/http_compression

  * http://www.mnot.net/cgi_buffer/

  * http://webreference.com/internet/software/servers/http/compression/

- Better error handling.

- Perhaps store some content gzip'd in the database to save disk space and
  eliminate the run-time compression.

- Take in more consideration usability issues and try to improve them.

- More commenting.

- Internationalization.

- Tabbed browsing in the XUL interface (via the <tabbrowser> tag).
