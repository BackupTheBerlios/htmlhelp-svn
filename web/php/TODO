Things to be done (by no particular order):

- Be nicer to web caches for bandwith saving since generated TOCs and indexes
  can be quite big. Some resources are:

  * http://www.mnot.net/cache_docs/

  * http://www.ircache.net/cgi-bin/cacheability.py 

- Better error handling (detection- and recovery-wise).

- Work on usability, especially:

  * Facilitate the navigation with lesser clicks.

  * Beautify the stylesheet to ease the reading.

- More commenting.

- Internationalization.

- Tabbed browsing in the XUL interface (via the <tabbrowser> tag). (It might
  not be possible at all with remote XUL.)

- Advanced search/filtering.

- Add a book "about" page, with metadata and some statistics.

- Add "Previous", "Next" and "Up" buttons to the page navigation.

- Highlight the search terms in pages.
