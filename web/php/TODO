Things to be done (by no particular order):

- Be nicer to web caches for bandwith saving since TOC and indexes can be quite
  big. Some resources are:

  * http://php.weblogs.com/http_compression

  * http://www.mnot.net/cgi_buffer/

  * http://webreference.com/internet/software/servers/http/compression/

- Better error handling.

- Take in more consideration usability issues and try to improve them:

  * Facilitate the navigation with lesser clicks.

  * Beautify the stylesheet to ease the reading.

- More commenting.

- Internationalization.

- Tabbed browsing in the XUL interface (via the <tabbrowser> tag). (It might
  not be possible at all with remote XUL.)

- Filtering in the TOC and book list (in every navigation tab, as matter of fact).

- Advanced search/filtering.

- Add a book about page, with metadata and some statistics.
